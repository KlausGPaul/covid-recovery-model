# covid-recovery-model

An attempt to develop metrics that indicate COVID-19 recovery from case data.

## Background

This notebook takes the data from [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) with a view to compute gradients, i.e. acceleration (or, hopefully, deceleration) of infections to understand and model how effective measures are in various countries.

This repository is not meant to be yet another dashboard on how the virus spreads, I felt that I have serious problems understanding exponentially growing datasets much like most humans, working on this notebook helps me understand that the drastic measures countries are currently taking to reduce the spread of the virus actually show positive effects.

## How to use

You need to separately download the [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) data and modify the path to the datafiles are required.
